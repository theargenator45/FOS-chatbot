Despite Mr. M's charitable work during the pandemic, he could have extended his mileage limit or purchased an unlimited mileage warranty. Volkswagen's call center remained open during the pandemic, so Mr. M could have made changes to his policy if desired. The ombudsman did not uphold Mr. M's complaint, but noted his concerns about Volkswagen continuing to take payments after the warranty cancellation, which should be addressed directly with Volkswagen.\",\n",
       " 'DRN-2051156_2020-09-11': \"Mr. W complained that Sporting Index Limited (SIL) unfairly withheld his winnings from a new account promotion. The promotion offered £100 to bet with, with the stipulation that any losses over £100 would be the customer's liability and any net profits would be theirs to keep. Mr. W made £70.83 in profit and £36.75 in losses, resulting in a net profit of £34.08. SIL removed £100 from his account, leaving him with £34.08. Mr. W argued that he should have been allowed to keep his total profit of £70.83, while SIL maintained that the terms of the promotion were clear and that Mr. W had retained his net profit. The ombudsman agreed with SIL, finding that the promotion was not misleading and that Mr. W's winnings had not been unfairly withheld.\",\n",

       "\" Miss C purchased a used car through a hire purchase agreement from Oodle Financial Services in September 2019, but experienced various issues with the car's quality. An independent inspection revealed frontal damage to the car, which Miss C believes was present at the point of sale. Oodle initially rejected Miss C's complaint, but the Financial Ombudsman Service upheld it, finding that the car was not of satisfactory quality. The Ombudsman ordered Oodle to end the hire purchase agreement, refund Miss C's payments, and pay her compensation for distress and inconvenience. Oodle must also remove any adverse information about the agreement from Miss C's credit file.\""
